# 🐧 Pingu Expedition @ DSC 2025

Welcome to the repository of our **Pingu Research Group**, a team dedicated to advancing scientific knowledge through field expeditions focused on penguin habitats, behavior, and environmental changes.

This repository serves as a collaborative hub for our research activities. Over time, it will grow to include expedition folders documenting fieldwork and collecting data.  

Stay curious and stay warm out there! 🧊🐧
